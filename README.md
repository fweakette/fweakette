# Hi...
So I don't know what to put here, but I do know how to do stuff.<br>
Even though I keep most of my repos private I do regularly work on projects.<br>
Most of my stuff is AI projects mainly using Tensorflow mabye Pytorch but all I really do is automate games with CV and statistics stuff.

# Langs
- Python (Fluent)
- Rust (Fluent)
- HTML (Fluent)
- C++ (Familiar)
- C (Familiar)
- ASM (Familiar)
- Java (Ehh)
- JavaScript (Ehh)

# Projects
- Copperhead : Python to asm compiler (rust )
- Lyra : architecture for a mp3 to lyrics model that also have line timestamps (pytorch)
- WordleGod : ai that predicts and plays wordle (tensorflow)
- nothing else i really want to talk about right now although ill update it later i guess (i've done more stuff other than this)
