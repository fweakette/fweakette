# Hi, I'm Airiy
<p>So in a nutshell im a self taught programmer who has been doing this since 2019, I also don't make alot of my stuff public until I'm fully done with them, and most of my projects I get them to a functional state but then I get bored (ADHD) so I start working on something else and never finish or posish the last project and kinda just leave it which is why there are a bunch of projects listed but none are public :(</p><p> 
I can do both frontend and backend so I'm basically fullstack but I definately prefer backend stuff because all my creativity kinda fell in a pit. Also later when I'm trying to get a job ill refine my readme and make a ton of my stuff public.</p>
