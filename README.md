# Hi...
So I don't know what to put here, but I do know how to do stuff.<br>
Even though I keep most of my repos private I do regularly work on projects, and if I'm confident in them I'll make them public.<br>

# Langs

  ###### Ehh means i can understand it kinda
- `Python` (Fluent)
- `Rust` (Fluent)
- `HTML` (Fluent)
- `C++` (Familiar)
- `C` (Familiar)
- `ASM` (Familiar)
- `Java` (Ehh)
- `JavaScript` (Ehh)

# Projects
